# Password Manager

### 1. Comprehensive Password Management System
Developed a full-featured password manager application using React, enabling users to securely store, manage, and edit their passwords. Features include saving, editing, deleting, and copying passwords, as well as toggling password visibility.

### 2. Customizable and Responsive User Interface
Designed a responsive and visually appealing user interface using Tailwind CSS. Implemented custom styles and a dynamic layout that adapts to different screen sizes, enhancing the overall user experience.

### 3. State Management and Data Persistence
Utilized React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) for efficient state management and implemented local storage to ensure data persistence across browser sessions. This approach ensures that user data is retained even after the application is closed or refreshed.

### 4. User Notifications and Interaction Enhancements
Integrated `react-toastify` for user notifications, providing real-time feedback on actions such as saving, copying, and deleting passwords. Enhanced user interaction with clipboard functionality and dynamic visual elements, including a password visibility toggle and GitHub integration button.
